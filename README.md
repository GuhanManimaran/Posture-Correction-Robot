# Posture-Correction-Robot
An Arduino-based gesture detection system using the MPU6050 sensor to monitor pitch and roll. When significant motion is detected, two servo motors move to an active position, simulating actions like opening a lid or waving. Once stable, the servos return to their resting state.
